      <p>Learn Enough to be dangerous is a leader in the movement to <em>Technical sophitication</em>
         the seemingly magical abilitiy to take command of your computer
        and get it to do your bidding.This include everything from command lines and coding
        to guessing keyboards shortcuts, Googling errors messages, and knowing when to just reboot
        and the darn thing.We believe there are <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em> who can benefit from learning
        technical sophisiphication,probaly more. To  join our movement,<a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our

        In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
        Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="padding:2px 20px; background: #ff00ff;">
        <p>
          <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
          <br>
          â€”Abraham Lincoln
